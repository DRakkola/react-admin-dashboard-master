### Color Scheme: 
I revamped the color scheme to create a more harmonious and engaging visual experience. Careful consideration was given to the contrast and readability of text, buttons, and other elements to ensure accessibility.

### Layout Enhancements:
The layout has been restructured to improve the organization of information and optimize the flow of content. This makes it easier for users to navigate and find relevant information.

## Issues

I noticed that the sidebar animation, while visually working correctly and providing a smooth user experience, is generating a console error. Despite its functionality, this error should be addressed to ensure the project's codebase is clean and error-free.
